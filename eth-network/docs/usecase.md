### Introduction
This use case has been specifically developed for financial projects that want to launch web3 services using CircleChain Gitshock Labs. The information contained here is not intended to provide strict rules, but rather loose guidelines to help developers think about where to start building their ideal blockchain.

### Problem
Finance has long been limited by the constraints of web2. Banking and other classic financial services often cannot reach parts of the world that are still developing. Extreme cases can occur with people running a local banking system among themselves where each unit or member of their community contributes to a "bank" - someone who is responsible for the collective funds. All of these cases have different patterns - people save their savings, in cash form, because they do not trust classic financial institutions. Blockchain, especially DeFi, which has grown rapidly in popularity in the last 2 years, presents perfect opportunities. It is much easier, legally, time-wise, and marketing-wise, to create an online service on technology that is considered liberating and therefore desirable, than to set up a bank and persuade people to come there.
